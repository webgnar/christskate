Skateboarding Speedrun Game - Project Plan
=====================================

A Three.js-based endless runner skateboarding game inspired by Subway Surfers.

Core Game Mechanics
------------------
1. Movement System
   - Forward momentum (constant or player-controlled speed)
   - Lane switching (left/right movement)
   - Jumping/grinding mechanics
   - Trick system for scoring/speed boosts
   - Collision detection and response

Visual Components
----------------
1. Environment
   - Procedurally generated endless track
   - Urban environment assets (buildings, rails, ramps, obstacles)
   - Different themes/environments for variety
   - Level of detail system for performance

2. Character
   - Skateboard physics and animations
   - Character model and animations
   - Trick animations
   - Customization options (future feature)

Technical Architecture
---------------------
1. Core Systems
   - Scene management
   - Physics system (can use Three.js built-in or add Cannon.js/Ammo.js)
   - Input handling
   - Camera system (third-person following camera)
   - Collision detection system
   - Scoring system

2. Performance Optimization
   - Object pooling for obstacles and collectibles
   - Chunk-based level generation
   - Asset loading and unloading
   - Level of detail (LOD) management

Development Approach
-------------------
1. Initial Prototype
   - Basic movement mechanics
   - Simple endless runner with primitive shapes
   - Core collision detection

2. System Implementation
   - Independent, modular systems
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Centralized state management

3. Performance Considerations
   - Object pooling
   - Efficient chunk loading/unloading
   - Render distance and LOD optimization
   - Object instancing

4. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for core systems
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Gameplay testing framework

Recommended Starting Points
--------------------------
1. Basic scene setup with simple character and platform
2. Movement system implementation
3. Simple procedural level generation

Each component should be built with extensibility in mind, allowing for future features and improvements while maintaining a solid foundation for the core gameplay mechanics.
