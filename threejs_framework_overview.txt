Three.js Framework Overview
========================

This is a Three.js project template that provides a comprehensive structure for 3D web graphics development. Here's a breakdown of the key components and capabilities:

1. Project Structure
------------------
/src        - Core source code
/examples   - Example implementations and demos
/build      - Built/compiled files
/docs       - Documentation
/editor     - Editor-related functionality
/utils      - Utility functions and helpers
/test       - Test files
/playground - Development and testing area

2. Core Capabilities
------------------
- 3D scene creation and management
- WebGL rendering
- Geometry and mesh handling
- Material and texture management
- Lighting and shadow systems
- Camera controls and viewports
- Animation system
- Asset loading and management

3. Development Tools
------------------
- Modern build system
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Editor configuration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Testing framework
- Example implementations

4. Key Features
-------------
- WebGL-based 3D rendering
- Extensive geometry primitives
- PBR materials support
- Real-time shadows and lighting
- Camera controls (orbit, fly, etc.)
- Scene graph management
- Animation system
- Loader system for various 3D formats
- Post-processing effects
- Particle systems

5. Development Environment
------------------------
- Node.js based development
- Modern JavaScript/ES6+ support
- Module bundling
- Development server
- Hot reloading
- Source maps for debugging

This template provides a solid foundation for building 3D web applications using Three.js, with all necessary tools and structure for both development and production environments.
